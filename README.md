# Piping Data Encryption

## Some things about my project

•	My project utilized pipes and the Java Process class to emulate how a CPU manages tasks by concurrently running three distinct programs.

•	I implemented a logger program to record all user activity and an encryption program using the Vigenère cipher to ensure secure communication.

•	Created a driver program that facilitates communication between the logger and encryption programs through pipes.

•	Logged all user activity to a text file to enable accountability and traceability.
